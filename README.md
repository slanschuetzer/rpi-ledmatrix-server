# Rpi-ledmatrix-server

This is a small program for driving my 8x32-ledmatrix (neopixel) i built in a box containing a pi, some sensors and a power-supply. Just cloned this repo as i wanted to save me some time by not writing my own webapi in c. At a first glance i don't really like the network-code, but it should be enough for a first shot. 
The main goal of this project will be (apart from refreshing my c-abilities from 20 years ago) to serve as a single server, that will operate the led-matrix, so i'm later able to feed it from several external sources like other programs on the pi (eg. to show temperature or other sensor-data), android-app, network-sources (e.g. nagios) and whatsoever...
I will try to keep most functionality and only add a function to send text that will be displayed on the matrix. 

Everything from here is the old documentation and most of it still valid, but some stuff no more...
Perhaps i will correct it later...

# Rpi-ws2812-server
This is a small program for driving the WS281x (a.k.a. [NeoPixel](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12999)) LEDs from a webserver, command line, text file, Python,... using the Raspberry Pi. It uses the rpi_ws281x PWM driver code from jgarff ([https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)). The LEDs can be controlled by sending text commands to a tcp socket. These commands can be generated by a webserver script, android app,... It's also possible to control the leds directly from the command line or by loading text file containing some predefined color patterns.

# Installation
On the raspberry you open a terminal window and type following commands:
* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get install gcc make git libjpeg-dev libpng-dev`
* `git clone https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server.git`
* `cd rpi-ws2812-server`
* `make`
* `sudo chmod +x ws2812svr`

Newer versions require libjpeg-dev and libpng-dev for reading PNG and JPEG images.
If you don't want to use JPEG or PNG you can disable this using:
* `make NO_JPEG=1 NO_PNG=1`

On newer Raspbian (Jessie) operating system the audio output is activated by default, you need to disable this:
You can do this by blacklisting the sound module:
`sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/snd-blacklist.conf`
```
blacklist snd_bcm2835
```

also in `/boot/config.txt` you comment out the `audio=on` parameter:
```
# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
#dtparam=audio=on
```

# Testing
Connect your LEDs to the PWM output of the Raspberry Pi and start the program:

* `sudo ./ws2812svr`

Now first initialize the driver code from jgarff by typing 'setup'.
On the following line you must **replace 10** by the number of leds you have attached!.

* `setup 1,10`
* `init`

Now you can type commands to change the color of the leds.
For example make them all red:

* `fill 1,FF0000`
* `render`

# Supported commands
Here is a list of commands you can type or send to the program. All commands have optional comma seperated parameters. The parameters must be in the correct order!


* `init` command must be called everytime the program is started after the setup command, this will initialize resource on the Pi according to the setup command
```
init  
    init 
		<frequency>, 					#Frequency to use for communication to the LEDs, default 800000
		<dma> 					        #dma channel number to use, default 10 be careful not to use any channels in use by the system as this may crash your SD card/OS
									    #use cat /proc/device-tree/soc/dma@7e007000/brcm,dma-channel-mask to see which channels (bitmask) might be used by the OS
```

* `setup` command must be called everytime the program is started:
```
setup  
    setup 
		<channel>, 						#channel number
		<led_cols>, 					#number of columns in the matrix
        <led_rows>,                     #number of rows in the matrix
		<led_type>, 					#type of led (3 color or 4 color) default 0
		<invert>, 						#invert output, default 0
		<global_brightness>, 			#global brightness level for channel (0-255), default 255
		<gpionum>						#GPIO output number, default 18 for more see 'GPIO usage' at this page: [https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)
	
	Possible LED types:
		0 WS2811_STRIP_RGB
		1  WS2811_STRIP_RBG
		2  WS2811_STRIP_GRB
		3  WS2811_STRIP_GBR
		4  WS2811_STRIP_BRG
		5  WS2811_STRIP_BGR
		6  SK6812_STRIP_RGBW
		7  SK6812_STRIP_RBGW
		8  SK6812_STRIP_GRBW
		9  SK6812_STRIP_GBRW
		10 SK6812_STRIP_BRGW
		11 SK6812_STRIP_BGRW

    My fork changed the parameters of this setup-command that instead of one led_count you have to 
    pass the rows and the cols of the matrix. You should still be able to use the fork with a 
    normal led-strip by passing nr_rows=1 and nr_cols=the amount of leds of your strip.

    Example:
    setup 1,32,8,3
```

        <loops>,                        #how often the text runs through the matrix (default: 1, also deprecated, you can use the 'loop' command instead.)
        <inout>,                        #if the text shold run into the matrix or already start displayed in the matrix (And the same for the end of the text.) (default 1 and i guess this should not really be configurable.)
        <reverse2ndrow>                 #just tells, if the index of each 2nd row are inverted like my longruner-matrix. default 1 (=yes) (hopefully soon deprecated, this really should be part of setup-command)

Examples:
    marquee 1,/FF0000Red /888888and /0000FFblue /888888 are colors/, that i like.,40 
        this will display the text "Red and blue are colors, that i like." with blue and read displayed in their corresponding color.
```
* `save_state` saves current color and brightness values of a channel to a CSV file, format is:
			   8 character hex number for color + , + 2 character hex for brightness + new line: WWBBGGRR,FF
               the CSV file can be loaded with load_state command.
```
	save_state
		<channel>,						#channel number to use
		<filename>,					    #file where to save the data
		<start>,						#start saving at led index (default is led 0)
		<len> 							#save this number of leds (default is the entire led string)
```


* `load_state` loads saved color and brightness values from CSV file. see save_state for format.
```
	load_state
		<channel>,						#channel number to load to
		<filename>,						#the file where to load from
		<start>,						#start loading at this LED index
		<len>							#load this number of LEDs from the file
```

* `set_thread_exit_type` only if using TCP mode and threads. This will set if the thread should be aborted when next client connects and immediately start execute next commands or
					     wait until the thread completes execution of the script and start next script received from client.
						 The client will receive READY + (newline CR + LF) when the previous script exited and it's ready to take new commands.
```
	set_thread_exit_type
		<thread_id>,					#The thread number, always 0
		<type> 							#exit type: 0 aborts current running thread and immediate execute next commands
												    1 wait until previous transmitted commands complete, then start next script
```


# Special keywords
You can add `do ... loop` to repeat commands when using a file or TCP connection.

For example the commands between `do` and `loop` will be executed 10 times:
```
do   
   <enter commands here to repeat>    
loop 10
```
Endless loops can be made by removing the '10'.
Inside a loop you can use {i} for the loop counter as function argument where i is the loop index (for loop inside loop)
For example {0} will be automatically replace by 0,1,2,3,4:

``` 
do
	fill 1, FF0000, {0}, 1
loop 5
render
```

is the same as the C-style code:

```
for (i=0;i<5;i++){
	fill 1, FF0000, i, 1
}
```

If you have nested loops you can increase the {0} to {1}, {2},...

``` 
do 
	do
		fill 1, FF0000, {1}, 1
	loop 5
	render
loop
```

Also possible to add a step value for the loop index to fill every "even" led

``` 
do
	fill 1, FF0000, {0}, 1
loop 5,2
```

is the same as:

```
for (i=0;i<5;i+=2){
	fill 1, FF0000, i, 1
}
```

To create an alternating pattern of colors use rotate commands in a loop.
For a 300 LED string this will create alternating RED-YELLOW-GREEN-BLUE-PINK colors:
```
do
    rotate 1,1,1,FF0000
    rotate 1,1,1,FFFF00
    rotate 1,1,1,00FF00
    rotate 1,1,1,0000FF
	rotate 1,1,1,FF00FF
loop 60
```

For `do ... loop` to work from a TCP connection we must start a new thread. 
This thread will continue to execute the commands when the client disconnects from the TCP/IP connection. 
The thread will automatically stop executing the next time the client reconnects (ideal for webservers).

For example:
```
thread_start   
   do  
      rotate 1,1,2  
     render  
     delay 200  
  loop  
thread_stop  
<client must close connection now>   
```

# PHP example
First start the server program:

* `sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp`

Then run the php code from the webserver:

```PHP
//create a rainbow for 10 leds on channel 1:  
send_to_leds("setup 1,10;init;brightness 1,32;");  
function send_to_leds ($data){  
   $sock = fsockopen("127.0.0.1", 9999);  
   fwrite($sock, $data);  
   fclose($sock);  
}
```

# Command line parameters
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp 9999`
  Listens for clients to connect to port 9999 (default).
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -f text_file.txt`
  Loads commands from text_file.txt.
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -p /dev/ws281x`
  Creates a file called `/dev/ws281x` where you can write you commands to with any other programming language (do-loop not supported here).
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -i "setup 1,4,5;init;"`
  Initializes with command setup 1,4,5  and command init
* `sudo ./ws2812svr -c /etc/ws2812svr.conf`
  Loads with settings from /etc/ws2812svr.conf

# Running as a service
To run as service run make install after compilation and adjust the config file in /etc/ws2812svr.conf
```
make
sudo make install
```

After installing service it will run by default in TCP mode on port 9999, if you want to change this you must edit the config file:
```
sudo nano /etc/ws2812svr.conf
```
change the mode to:
tcp for TCP mode (change the port= setting)
file for file mode (change the file= setting for location of file)
pipe for named pipe mode (change the pipe= setting for the location of the named pipe)
mode must be first setting in the conf file!
init setting can be used to initialize the led count and type fill color,...
```
mode=tcp
port=9999
file=/home/pi/test.txt
pipe=/dev/leds
init=
```

# Complicated animations
If you need to create complicated animations I suggest to save the color values (each led 1 pixel) in a png or jpg image file and load this file with the readpng command.
If you have a LED string of 300 leds best is to create an image file which is 300 pixels wide and X pixels high.
